# Slidely AI-Task 2 (FORMS APP)

This app is made as a submission for Slidely.Ai take home task.

It has two components,the Forms App and its backend.
Make sure to run the backend app first then the Windows app.

# Backend (Nodejs+Typescript)

Clone the repo/folder to any desired folder.Then open any command line editor of choice.

Ideally one should run "npm build --tsc" but I have provided the build files here itself.

Simply execute "npm run start" to start the backend server.
